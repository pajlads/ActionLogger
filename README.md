# Action Logger

Action Logger logs actions your character makes to disk in a programmatically accessible format. These actions intend to make debugging quest helpers easier.

These actions include:

- Dialogues (each dialogue screen text, the options available, the last interacted npc, and the option chosen (if possible))
- Varbit changes
- Maybe player movements?
